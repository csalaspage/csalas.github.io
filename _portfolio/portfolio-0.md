C.A.S.A.: Collaborative Approach for Student Activities
======
Building on motivation and gamification theories, my colleague Sarah Jenkins and I introduced C.A.S.A. (Collaborative Approach for Student Activities - A home for collegiate group piano) during Fall 2022 to encourage student autonomy and to provide collegiate group piano teachers with additional resources. C.A.S.A. is an online open access database of activities based on three essential functional skills taught in accredited music programs in the USA and Canada: (1) harmonization, (2) sight-reading, and (3) improvisation.  Using C.A.S.A. as a game, we were able to encourage student collaboration through competition, to increase practice time through incentives, and to foster reflection through group discussion. We provided extrinsic and intrinsic motivation through competition, inexpensive material rewards, and recognition. Ideally, C.A.S.A. intends to be an open access repository for group piano teachers around the world.
