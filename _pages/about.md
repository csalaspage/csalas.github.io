I am a pianist, teacher, and researcher with a Ph.D. in Music Education with emphasis in Piano Pedagogy from Louisiana State University. My research focuses on the interface between psychology and piano pedagogy, with special attention to motivation and interest development in piano students.

As an educator, I work on being comfortable recognizing my privileges, strengths, and weaknesses in hopes that it will foster the same abilities in my students and allow them to be engaged with their learning processes. As a music education/piano teacher, I strive to achieve a profound understanding and level of reflection about music education, performance, and piano pedagogy.

Areas of interest
======
1. Piano pedagogy
2. Music education
3. Piano performance

Research philosophy
------
I aim for my research to be interdisciplinary and application oriented. Additionally, to studying motivation and interest development, my research focuses on exploring healthy musicianship practices in the private piano studio. Simultaneously, I aim to understand how preservice music teachers acquire pedagogical content knowledge in healthy musicianship to foster wellness and self-care in college music school. 

Teaching philosophy
------
The student that leaves my class is one who loves experiencing music in all its dimensions, a student that loves learning, and that is not afraid of to ask the BIG questions. I aspire for the students who leave my class to be not only the ones that read music effectively and participate with a fulfillment feeling in recitals, or small and informal ensembles, but also feel free to take their own path and express their own creativity by exploring their unique voice. They are aware of their sociocultural environment and recognize the crucial role that they have in the community. If so, I will know that my teaching was successful. If not, I will keep working harder to be the teacher they deserve, and to keep up with the high standard of teaching quality that I learned from my previous music teachers as well.
